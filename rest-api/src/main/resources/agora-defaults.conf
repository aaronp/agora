# when creating subscriptions or otherwise telling other services what our address is,
# we can't say '0.0.0.0' or 'localhost'. It needs to be the actual host name reachable from
# somewhere. This value can be one of:
#
# 1) 'from-config-host' in which case it will use the 'host' value from this config
# 2) 'from-inet-hostname', in which case it will use the [[InetAddress]] getHostName from this started server
# 3) 'from-inet-hostaddress', in which case it will use the [[InetAddress]] getHostAddress from this started server
# 4) 'from-inet-canonical-hostname', in which case it will use the [[InetAddress]] getHostName from this started server
# 5) 'from-env-XXX', where XXX is the system environment variable name
# 6) 'from-prop-XXX', where XXX is the system property name
# 7) the value verbatim from the configuration
